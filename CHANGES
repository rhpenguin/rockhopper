           -> Management)

  - [New] [Routing/Hub: IP over IP and GRE encapsulation] Directly 
          routing and forwarding packets between VPN tunnels.
  
  - [New] [Routing] Peer address registration by NHRP and GRE over 
          IPsec are supported. [RFC2332][RFC2784] 

  - [New] [DMVPN] Started to support Dynamic Mesh VPN (i.e. Dynamic 
          Multipoint VPN (DMVPN): Shortcut Switching Enhancements 
          for NHRP) based on the internet-draft (draft-detienne-dmvpn-01) 
          by Cisco.
          (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-detienne-dmvpn-01) 

          *** Interoperability evaluation by using IKEv2 has NOT been done
          yet. I would appreciate your contribution if you would evaluate 
          and debug Rockhopper with Cisco devices implementing IKEv2. ***
          
  - [New] [DMVPN] A session ticket issued by hub node (authenticator) 
          for spoke-to-spoke (shortcut) authentication (Rockhopper's 
          private extension). By enabling it, a kind of SSO property 
          like Kerberos Authentication can be added between spoke nodes. 
          (i.e.) Even if each spoke node uses PSK or EAP as an auth 
          method, keys or passwords for other remote spoke nodes need 
          not to be configured on it. You just need to configure a key
          or a password to connect your spoke node with the hub node.
          See app/rhp_ikev2_auth_tkt_hb2spk.c for protocol details.          

  - [New] [Packet capture/PCAP] A packet capture tool is supported. 
          A capture file including plaintext and ciphertext packets of 
          ESP and IKEv1/v2 handled by Rockhopper can be saved in PCAP 
          format and viewed by network protocol analyzer like Wireshark. 
          The file can be gotten by Web Console (Management / Tool 
          -> Packet Capture). 
          
  - [New] [IKEv1] Started to support legacy IKEv1 for an interoperability 
          purpose. However, I strongly recommend using more secure, 
          reliable, extensible, interoperable and multifunctional IKEv2.
          
  - [New] [IKEv1] IKEv1 XAUTH (PSK, RSA-Sig and hybrid Authentication) and 
          Mode-Config as a responder side are supported for legacy IKEv1 
          VPN clients. Currently, only PAP (by local authentication) is 
          implemented.

          and Android.
  
  - [New] [Web Console/Monitoring & Statistics] Showing Routing table/cache 
          and NHRP cache. A command-line tool (/usr/local/sbin/rockhopper) 
          also supports it.

  - [Improved] [Gateway/Packet Forwarding] Hash table sizes for MAC, 
               ARP(IPv4) and ND(IPv6) caches are configurable. 
               (Global setting: rhp_gcfg_mac_cache_hash_size and 
                rhp_gcfg_neigh_cache_hash_size)

          CentOS 7.2 and LinuxMint 18.

  - [Regression/Fixed] Failed to configure 3DES-CBC for Child SAs by Web 
                       Console (Global Configuration -> Crypto Algorithms 
                       -> Add Child SA's Algorithms).

  - [Improved] [Alg] MD5 is removed from default integ/prf methods. 

  - [Improved] [IKEv2/Auth-ID] ID_IPV4_ADDR and ID_IPV6_ADDR are supported.

  - [Improved] [Web Console/Event Viewer] Add the 'Automatically update 
               view' checkbox to enable/disable automatically scrolling on 
               the Event log view. If uncheck it, you can update the view by 
               pushing the 'Update View' button. By default, it is enabled
               (checked) as usual.

  - [Improved] [IKEv2/Child SA] A setting not to narrow traffic selectors. [Exact Match]
  
  - [Improved] [Gateway/Packet Forwarding] A setting not to forward decrypted packets
               between VPN connections (i.e. Remote IPsec nodes). In this case, 
               decrypted packets are forwarded only between a remote IPsec node and 
               protected network.

  - [Fixed] [IKEv2/IPv6:Remote Client] There may be a case where internal network info 
            (internal route info) was not cleared when a VPN connection was closed.

  - [Fixed] [ESP/IKEv2 MOBIKE] A bug, which may potentially cause a dead lock when  
            I/F address or state is dynamically changed, was fixed.

               receiving a resolution request (ARP/ND) for the same IP address from 
               a different side (RHP_BRIDGE_SIDE_VPN or RHP_BRIDGE_SIDE_TUNTAP).

  - [Improved] [IKEv2 Sess Resumption] A few additional security checks.

  - [NEW] [VPN connection] A VPN connection's lifetime. If it expires, the connection
          is closed.

  - [NEW] [IKEv2/Remote Configutaion] IPv6 address Auto-configuration for a remote  
          client. This spec includes a Rockhopper's private extension 
          (See app/rhp_ikev2_cfg.c for protocol details).

          Mode for remote clients.

  - [NEW] [IKEv2/Remote Configutaion] A setting to reject traffic selectors requested 
          by remote client. This means that a remote client need to obey traffic 
          selectors specified by remote configuration server.

  - [New] [Installer] Tested on Ubuntu 15.10, Debian 8.2, LinuxMint 17.2 and Fedora 23.

  - [Fixed] [Web Console/js] When a Web browser shutdowns a httpBusRead connection 
            (HTTP GET), it may return an empty content instead of an error event 
            (e.g. Firefox 43.0). In this case, the event is just ignored.

          Avoid adding a new VPN connection on the new 'Network & Internet' Window 
          (Start Menu > Settings > VPN > 'Add a VPN connection') because there may 
          be a case where an IPv4 defaut route via the connection is not added. 
          Instead, set up the new connection on the 'Network and Sharing Center' 
          window (Start Menu > Settings > Network & Internet > VPN > Network and 
          Sharing Center > 'Set up a new connection and network') and configure 
          IKEv2 for it on the each VPN adapter's 'Properties' window. (Start Menu 
          > Settings > Network & Internet > VPN > 'Change adapter options' 
          > Right-click The created VPN adapter's icon.) Of course, you can open 
          the 'Network and Sharing Center' window from the Control Panel like 
          Windows 7/8. I hope this spec or problem will be clarified by Microsoft.
   
  - [New] [Web Console] On the VPN Configuration view, showing created-time and
          updated-time of a VPN realm's config.
  
  - [Improved] [Web Console/rockhopper] When a configuration's backup file saved for  
               an old software package is uploaded and restored, required settings  
               for a new package are automatically added. 

  - [New] [Tool] A script to reset all configuration is included. 
                (rockhopper-<version>/installer/reset_config.sh)

  - [Fixed] [IKEv2/IPv6] A VPN client's linklocal address is not included in a CP 
            payload (CFG_REQUEST).
  
  - [Fixed] [Debug Trace] A few bad format args.

  - [Improved] [IKEv2/EAP Server] If an only single VPN realm is configured, it
               is treated as a default EAP server by default. 
               (Global setting: rhp_gcfg_def_eap_server_if_only_single_rlm_defined)

  - [Improved] [Debug Trace/Event Log] Add new conversion specifiers for time_t.

  - [Improved] [IKEv2/QCD] A token taker checks a source address of a received IKEv2 
               INVALID_IKE_SPI error notification with token maker's addresses  
               including MOBIKE's additional addresses and a secondary address 
               configured by user or resoloved by DNS-query.  

  
 * rockhopper-0.2.b1-019 [2015/05/23]

  - [New] IPv6 support.
  
          If you configure a Split DNS for your VPN (IPv6), it requires kernel v3.7 
          and later (supporting IPv6 NAT) and corresponding ip6tables 
         (e.g. Ubuntu 13.04 or later). 

  - [New] [IKEv2] IKEv2 Message Fragmentation [RFC7383].

  - [New] [Tool] A command-line admin tool (rockhopper) supports additional features.

      - Connecting VPN by EAP-MSCHAPv2.
      - Some obsolete or unsupported features were removed.
      - Improvements related to authentication info.
      - MOBIKE initiator's routability check.
      - Enabling or disabling a VPN realm's config.
      - Showing remote peer's certificates.

  - [New] [Tool] A command-line event-log tool (/usr/local/sbin/rockhopper_log).
      - Showing or following events.
      - Saving events as a text file.
      - Clearing old events.

  - [New] [Net Config] Network configuration scripts call iproute2's utilities instead 
          of legacy tools like ifconfig and route commands.

  - [Improved] [Bridge] Using a system's defaut gateway to forward decrypted packets
               destinated to other subnets if no static gateway's setting exists.

  - [New] [Web Console] On the VPN status view, showing results of MOBIKE initiator's 
          routability check (available paths to a remote peer). 

  - [New] [Web Console] Saving events as a text file.

  - [Improved] [Web Console] When a password/key string is submitted by a <form> or 
               <input> tag on Firefox, it shows a prompt dialog to save it into 
               the browser's cache. As a workaround, the passwords/keys are submitted 
               in other XML messages.

  - [Improved] [IKEv2/Remote Config Server] Cached assigned addresses for an EAP 
               client are bound only to the EAP identity value not including a

               (Global setting: eap_client_use_ikev2_random_addr_id)

  - [Improved] [IKEv2/ESP] Multiple IPv4 addresses configured for a single network 
               I/F are supported.

  - [Improved] [Tuntap I/F] When many virtual I/Fs are created, netlink's buffers to send
               NEWLINK and NEWROUTE messages may overflow. As a workaround, after receiving
               the messages related to a created interface from netlink, Rockhopper continues 
               to create the next interface one by one.

  - [Fixed] [IKEv2/Remote client] Static internal dev routes locally configured for 
            a remote client are added into the system after VPN connection is established.

 * rockhopper-0.2.b1-018-2 [2015/05/04]

  - [Fixed] [IKEv2] Initializing attributes of a packet buffer(rhp_packet) used for a  
            MOBIKE(Initiator) probe packet when it is released. This bug may cause a
            parse error of a received IKEv2 packet and a connection failure later when 
            the same rhp_packet is reallocated for the packet.

  - [Fixed] [Tuntap I/F] When read() returns with no data (length=0), the call is ignored.
  
  - [Fixed] [Debug Trace] A few bad format args.
  
  - [New] [Installer] Tested on Ubuntu 15.04.

  - [Fixed] [IKEv2] A memory leak of rhp_packet. [rhp_ikev2.c:_rhp_ikev2_rx_verify_request()].


 * rockhopper-0.2.b1-017 [2013/12/20]

  - [New] [IKEv2] An initiator can send a realm ID to a remote responder 
          in the IKE_AUTH exchange. 
          When multiple realms are configured and multiple VPN connections
          are established between the two nodes, the responder can distinguish 
          the initiator's membership for each connection by using the received
          realm ID. Therefore, each peer can use a common PSK's ID or 
          certificate for the realms. 
          (VPN Configuration -> IKE SA Settings: send_realm_id)

  - [Improved] [ESP] Preferentially forwarding ARP, OSPF, RIP and BGP packets.                
               (Global setting: forward_critical_pkt_preferentially)
               
  - [Improved] [IKEv2] [Mesh] Rejecting a VPN connection between a mesh node 
               and a hub node. When meshed VPN is deployed, each peer of the 
               VPN connection must be configured as a mesh node. 

  - [Improved] [ESP] [Hub and Spoke] A spoke node can flood packets from a 
               virtual (TUN/TAP) interface to VPN connections beween spoke 
               nodes when a VPN connection with a hub node is not available.
               (Global setting: flood_pkts_if_no_accesspoint_exists)

  - [Regression/Fixed] [IKEv2/RSA-Sig] Failed to establish a VPN connection 
                       when an initiator's peer is explicitly configured 
                       (i.e. not as ANY) on the responder's peer side and 
                       the initiator's certificate includes a subjectAltName.

  - [Improved] [Web Console] Show a hostname next to the title string.

  - [Improved] [IKEv2] Search configured peers for an initiator's realm ID
               on the responder's side.
               (Global setting: dont_search_cfg_peers_for_realm_id)

  - [New] [IKEv2] Peek in a received packet's header to get the packet's 
          length before actually reading it. This is a relatively inefficent 
          way because recvmesg() is called twice for each received packet. 
          However, if the system has small memory and large IKEv2 packets, 
          for example, IKE_AUTH packets including many CERT payloads, are 
          exchanged, this optional feature may be useful. By default, 
          it is disabled. (Global setting: peek_rx_packet_size)

  - [Fixed] [IKEv2] D-H public key: Correctly prepending zero bits
            (fixed wrong usage of OpenSSL API).

  - [Fixed] [IKEv2] Error N payload's protocol ID for some error types:  
            Not set IKE(1) but zero.

  - [Fixed] [DNS proxy] Segfault when reading more than three nameservers 
            (more than libc resolver's max) defined in /etc/resolv.conf.

  - [Improved] [IKEv2] Automatically add a dev route to forward packets  
               to VPN when CP(INTERNAL_IP4_SUBNET) attributes are received  
               and CP(INTERNAL_IP4_NETMASK) is /32 or is unkown.

  - [Improved] Add many log messages at the debug level.

  - [Improved] [IKEv2] EAP-MSCHAPv2: Add the optional Identity exchange 
               before the MSCHAPv2 exchange starts. 

  - [New] Add a RHP_WTS_DISP_RULE_MISC_BLOCKING worker thread for tasks 
          which may sleep or need blocking I/O.

  - [New] Add resolution by the nano/micro second for timers.

  - [Improved] [Web Mng] Add the MIME types (application/pkix-cert and 
               application/pkix-crl) to upload a PEM-encoded certificate or 
               CRL by Web Console (application/pkix-cert and application/pkix-crl). 
               But, currently, a DER-encoded file is not supported.

  - [Fixed] [Web Console] Correctly show saved certificate info when 
            multiple realms are configured.

  - [New] [IKEv2] Upper limit of VPN connections. 
          (Global setting: vpn_max_sessions)

  - [New] [IKEv2] Upper limit of half-open VPN connections. 
          (Global setting: vpn_max_half_open_sessions)

  - [New] [Installer] Supported Debian 7.1 (i386 and amd64).

  - [Obsoleted] [Web Console] "Connect VPN by Address" pain was obsoleted. 

  - [Fixed] [Web Console] "Reconnect" button for a responder on the VPN  
            peer pane was removed.

  - [Fixed] [DNS Proxy] Upper limit for open sockets to forward DNS queries.
            Also, aggressively cleaning up timed-out query sessions when
